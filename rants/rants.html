            Hi ------,<br>
            <br>
            I hope you are doing well.<br>
            I enjoy your films very much. Thank you for making them avilable on your website.<br>
            <br>
            Do you believe that film has a lineage of 'outsider artists' like film of music does?<br>
            <br>
            Do you believe that films will continue to be popular entertainment for the foreseeable future or are we seeing an inevitable sea-change into cinema becoming a niche art-form like jazz or poetry?<br>
            <br>
            What do you like to eat for breakfast?<br>
            Do you have the same breakfast every day?<br>
            <br>
            Which version of us is the real us? Who we are along in our heads or who we are when relaxed and distracted by others? I sometimes feel like those two people inside do not recognise each other.<br>
            <br>
            Do you believe that an e-mail can be art? Poetry?<br>
            <br>
            Is it possible to make art that is not self-conscious?<br>
            <br>
            Please do not feel obligated to answer all or any of these questions. I just like writing them and thought you might enjoy reading them.<br>
            <br>
            Again, I hope you are doing well.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            my name is<br>
